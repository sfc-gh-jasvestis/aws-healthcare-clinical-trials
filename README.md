# APJ Clinical Trial Site Operations - Enrollment and Risk-Based Monitoring

End-to-end site operations for **40 trial sites in a fictional multi-site trial portfolio across 5 APJ markets** (Singapore, Sydney, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei) using Snowflake, optionally with AWS: from a live visit-record alert to a 7-day important-deviation risk score, an alert email and an AI action memo for the clinical operations team. All data is synthetic and site-level: there are no patient records and no clinical outcomes.

## Architecture

A clinical operations pipeline built on **Snowflake** (Dynamic Tables, Snowflake ML, Cortex Search, Cortex Agent, Cortex AI_COMPLETE, SPCS) and, in the full build, **AWS** (Amazon Data Firehose, S3, Bedrock Claude, QuickSight + Amazon Q). Site visit-record events land in `RAW.LIVE_VISITS`. Dynamic tables curate 90 days of site-day history: participants screened and enrolled against plan, central-monitoring signals, confirmed important protocol deviations, CAPAs, monitoring visit compliance and essential document coverage. Snowflake ML scores 7-day important-deviation risk per site, forecasts portfolio enrollment and flags data query rate anomalies. A Cortex Agent answers questions with SOP citations, and an LLM drafts the clinical operations action memo.

Interactive diagrams (hover for object names): [Snowflake only](docs/architecture-snowflake.html) | [AWS + Snowflake](docs/architecture-aws.html). The app shows both on its Architecture & Data tab, the current build first. Regenerate them with `python3 docs/build_architecture.py`.

The Snowflake-only build drops the AWS subgraph: `APP.SIMULATE_VISITS` writes to `RAW.LIVE_VISITS`, and the app calls Cortex `AI_COMPLETE` instead of the Bedrock UDF.

## Snowflake Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Dynamic Tables | `CURATED.KPI_SUMMARY`, `PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY`, `SIGNAL_SUMMARY`, `TREND_ANALYSIS` from the RAW tables |
| Snowflake ML | CLASSIFICATION 7-day important-deviation risk (`ML.DEVIATION_RISK_SCORES`), 14-day enrollment FORECAST, data query rate ANOMALY_DETECTION |
| Cortex Search | 14 synthetic site-management SOPs (one per therapeutic area and monitoring signal type) in `SEARCH.SITE_SOP_SEARCH` |
| Semantic View | `APP.TRIAL_OPS_ANALYTICS` over sites, signal types, daily totals and risk |
| Cortex Agent | `APP.TRIAL_OPS_AGENT`: Cortex Analyst over the semantic view plus Cortex Search for SOP citations |
| Cortex AI | `AI_COMPLETE('claude-sonnet-4-5')` for grounded answers, and for the action memo in the Snowflake-only build |
| Alerts + Tasks | `APP.LIVE_VISIT_ALERT` logs ALERT events and sends email; task graph `TASK_REFRESH_CURATED`, then `TASK_RESCORE_RISK` |
| Snowpark Container Services | Next.js app `APP.APJ_TRIALS_APP` with 6 tabs: Executive Cockpit, Predictive, Site Monitoring, Live Visits, Ask AI, Architecture & Data |
| Snowpipe | `RAW.LIVE_VISITS_PIPE` AUTO_INGEST from S3 (AWS build only) |

## AWS Services

Used only in the AWS + Snowflake build.

| Service | Role in Demo |
|---------|-------------|
| Amazon Data Firehose | Direct PUT stream `apj-trials-visits` receives simulated site visit-record events and writes batches to S3 |
| Amazon S3 | Landing bucket (`visits/`). An event notification goes to the Snowpipe SQS queue |
| Amazon Bedrock | Claude Sonnet 4.5 writes the action memo, called from Snowflake through an external-access UDF |
| Amazon QuickSight | DIRECT_QUERY executive dashboard over Snowflake (daily enrollment and signals, important deviations by site, deviation risk) |
| Amazon Q | Natural-language questions over the QuickSight topic `apj-trials-topic` |
| AWS IAM | Least-privilege roles for S3, Firehose and Bedrock |

## Personas

These personas are fictional.

| Persona | Role | Key Questions |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Mei Tan** | Head of Clinical Operations | "Are we enrolling to plan?" "Which signal types turn into important deviations?" |
| **Arjun Rao** | Central Monitoring Lead | "Which sites are high risk this week, and which SOP applies?" |

## Data

All data is synthetic and seeded, so every rebuild reproduces it. The trial portfolio, sites and names are fictional. Tables hold site-level daily counts only: there are no patient records, no patient identifiers and no clinical outcomes, and nothing in this demo is a clinical, safety or efficacy claim.

| Table | Rows | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| RAW.SITES | 40 | Trial sites across 5 markets and 5 therapeutic areas (Oncology, Cardiology, Respiratory, Neurology, Metabolic), with monitoring tier and 90-day enrollment plan |
| RAW.SITE_DAILY | 3,600 | Daily site observations over 90 days: participants screened and enrolled, monitoring signals, confirmed important deviations, CAPAs, signal type, monitoring visits, data query rate and data-entry lag |
| RAW.ESSENTIAL_DOCUMENTS | 40 | Required, on-file and pending essential documents per site |
| SEARCH.SITE_SOP_DOCS | 14 | Synthetic site-management SOPs indexed for Cortex Search |
| RAW.LIVE_VISITS | Grows during the demo | Live visit-record events from Firehose (AWS build) or `APP.SIMULATE_VISITS` (Snowflake-only build) |
| ML.DEVIATION_RISK_SCORES | 40 | 7-day important-deviation probability and risk band per site |

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN access, and Cortex AI enabled (AI_COMPLETE, Search, Agent).
- An X-Small warehouse with auto-suspend at or below 120 s, and an existing SPCS compute pool.
- Python 3.11+, `snowflake-connector-python`, Node.js 22+, Docker and the `snow` CLI.
- App image: run `snow spcs image-registry login`, then build and push `apj-trials-app:v1` to the database's `APP.IMAGES` repository (see the header of `snowflake/07_deploy_app.sql`).
- AWS build only: `boto3`, AWS credentials for the target account (us-west-2) with Bedrock access, and QuickSight Enterprise.

### SPCS App
```
<DATABASE>.APP.APJ_TRIALS_APP
```

### Tests
```bash
python -m pytest aws snowflake quicksight
```

For a local run, put `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`, `SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`, `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE`, `SNOWFLAKE_AUTHENTICATOR=PROGRAMMATIC_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SNOWFLAKE_TOKEN` and `DEMO_PLATFORM` in the environment, then run `npm --prefix app run build && npm --prefix app start`.

## Build Modes

Both modes share the same core. They differ in three places, and the app's `DEMO_PLATFORM` setting (in its SPCS spec) switches the memo provider and the Live Visits tab.

| Layer | Snowflake Only | Full AWS + Snowflake |
|---|---|---|
| Live visit records | `CALL APP.SIMULATE_VISITS(n)` inserts simulated visit-record events into `RAW.LIVE_VISITS`. This simulates an EDC feed; it is not Snowpipe Streaming | `aws/publish_visits.py` to Amazon Data Firehose, then S3, SQS and Snowpipe AUTO_INGEST |
| Action memo | Cortex `AI_COMPLETE('claude-sonnet-4-5')` | Amazon Bedrock Claude Sonnet 4.5 through `APP.BEDROCK_GENERATE` |
| BI and natural-language questions | The SPCS app is the dashboard; questions go to the Cortex Agent | Also a QuickSight dashboard and an Amazon Q topic |
| App setting | `DEMO_PLATFORM: snowflake` | `DEMO_PLATFORM: aws` |

### Snowflake Only

```bash
# 1. Core data and dynamic tables (guarded: new isolated database only)
python snowflake/run_core.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_SNOWFLAKE --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --apply
# 2. Native visit-record feed, ML, search, semantic view, agent, alert and task graph
python snowflake/run_intelligence.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_SNOWFLAKE --platform snowflake --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --alert-email you@example.com
# 3. App on SPCS with DEMO_PLATFORM=snowflake (push the image first)
python snowflake/run_intelligence.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_SNOWFLAKE --platform snowflake --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --alert-email you@example.com --files 07_deploy_app.sql --compute-pool <COMPUTE_POOL>
```

During the demo:
- Run `CALL APP.SIMULATE_VISITS(20)` to add live visit-record events. For a continuous feed, run `ALTER TASK APP.TASK_SIMULATE_VISITS RESUME`, and `SUSPEND` it afterwards.
- Run `EXECUTE ALERT APP.LIVE_VISIT_ALERT` to raise the alert email.
- Run `EXECUTE TASK APP.TASK_REFRESH_CURATED` to refresh the curated tables and rescore risk.

Afterwards, drop the database or run `ALTER SERVICE APP.APJ_TRIALS_APP SUSPEND`.

### Full AWS + Snowflake

```bash
# 1. Core data and dynamic tables (guarded: new isolated database only)
python snowflake/run_core.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_AWS --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --apply
# 2. AWS ingestion and Bedrock (dry run first, then --apply)
python aws/setup_aws.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_AWS --account <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> --connection <CONNECTION> --apply
# 3. ML, search, semantic view, agent, alert and task graph
python snowflake/run_intelligence.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_AWS --platform aws --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --alert-email you@example.com
# 4. App on SPCS with DEMO_PLATFORM=aws (push the image first)
python snowflake/run_intelligence.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_AWS --platform aws --warehouse <XS_WAREHOUSE> --connection <CONNECTION> --alert-email you@example.com --files 07_deploy_app.sql --compute-pool <COMPUTE_POOL>
# 5. QuickSight dashboard and Q topic (needs an existing Snowflake data source)
python quicksight/build_dashboards.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_AWS --account <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> --principal-arn <QUICKSIGHT_USER_ARN> --data-source-arn <DATA_SOURCE_ARN> --prefix apj-trials --apply --update --with-topic
```

QuickSight objects must be shared with the QuickSight user who signs in (`--principal-arn`); otherwise the console shows nothing.

During the demo:
- Run `python aws/publish_visits.py --count 20` to send live visit-record events. Firehose buffers for up to 60 seconds before writing to S3.
- Run `EXECUTE ALERT APP.LIVE_VISIT_ALERT` to raise the alert email.
- Run `EXECUTE TASK APP.TASK_REFRESH_CURATED` to refresh the curated tables and rescore risk.

Afterwards, `python aws/teardown_aws.py --database APJ_CLINICAL_TRIALS_AWS --account <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> --connection <CONNECTION> --apply` removes the AWS resources and the account-level Bedrock external-access and S3 storage integrations. It leaves the email integration `APJ_TRIALS_EMAIL_INT`, which the Snowflake-only build also uses.

## Business Impact

Industry research and Snowflake customer outcomes:
- **A single day of delay in drug development** is worth approximately $800,000 in unrealized or lost prescription drug sales and $40,000 in direct daily clinical trial costs -- [Tufts CSDD, Quantifying the Value of a Day of Delay in Drug Development](https://csdd.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/2025-02/Aug2024%20Day%20of%20Delay%20White%20Paper%20Final.pdf)
- **Sanofi** (Snowflake customer) moved its real-world clinical data analytics engine from a managed Spark solution to Snowpark: 50% improvement in performance, and 100M patient records per cohort processed in four minutes on average -- [Snowflake customer story: Sanofi](https://www.snowflake.com/en/customers/all-customers/case-study/sanofi/)

## Key Demo Numbers

These figures are synthetic and come from the seeded demo data. Forecast and anomaly figures can shift slightly with the build day.

- **40 sites**, 3,600 site-days over 90 days, across 5 markets and 5 therapeutic areas
- **5,109 participants enrolled** against a plan of 5,634, so enrollment is at **90.7% of plan**; 6 sites are below 80% of plan. 7,044 screened, a 27.5% screen failure rate
- **593 monitoring signals** raised and **165 confirmed** as important deviations, a 27.8% signal confirmation rate; **83 CAPAs** opened
- **Visit window** produces the most important deviations (51 of 190 signals); the 16 regional EDC outage signals are never confirmed
- **Important-deviation model** out-of-time holdout: precision 0.44, recall 0.29 at a 0.5 threshold, against a 0.23 base rate. Seven sites are high risk; the top site is SITE-0002, at 81.4%
- **14-day enrollment forecast** of 48 to 66 participants per day, with prediction intervals; **36 of 640** site-days flagged as data query rate anomalies
- **Monitoring visit compliance 76.8%**, essential document coverage 60.0%, with 24 documents pending
- **14 SOPs** indexed for Cortex Search and cited by ID in agent answers
