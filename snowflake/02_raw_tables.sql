-- Synthetic site-day operations data for a fictional multi-site trial portfolio.
-- Site-level aggregate counts only: there are no patient records, no patient
-- identifiers and no clinical outcomes. Nothing is seeded as a prediction.
-- Randomness is HASH-seeded, so every rebuild is reproducible: per-site
-- deviation propensity, drift between monitoring visits, missed monitoring
-- visits, therapeutic-area-weighted monitoring signals, signals that are not
-- confirmed on review, and two regional EDC outages.
